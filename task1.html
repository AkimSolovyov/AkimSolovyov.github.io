        “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men
        who find it easier to live in the world they’ve been given
        than to explore the power they have to change it.
        Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion.
        Impossible is not a declaration. It’s a dare.
        Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary.
        Impossible is nothing.”

        - Muhammad Ali
